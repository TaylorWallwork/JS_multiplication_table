            <h1>Hi I'm Taylor!</h1>
            <p>I love almost any outdoor activity but have a passion for fly fishing, mountain biking, and skiing. I am an intellectually curious individual and love to learn something new everyday. I earned my bachelors degree in Political Science from the University of Utah in 2016. I have recently finished another chapter in my education at the Davis Technology College, where I studied digital media design with an emphasis in web development.</p>

              <h3>Nervous Nelly</h3>
              <p>I am typically a very calm individual. However, I have been known to get a little anxious in the ocean. It is an uneasy feeling not knowing what is beneath you in one of mother natures most powerful properties. I would like to surf but sharks freak me out!</p>

              <h3>Accessability</h3>
              <p>One of my greatest moments as a developer was when I had the opportunity of optimizing a website to be ADA compliant. It was not only a great learning experience, but it also helped those who need additional support to have an exceptional user experience.</p>

              <h3>Enjoy the Melody</h3>
              <p>Music is my favorite aspect of pop culture. Although I am genre specific, music has always been a way to bring people together and express myself. It seems that no matter how tough things are personally of politically, music can help in some fashion or another.</p>
